# General Overview

This folder contains the following:

- 1st version:

The first version of our sensor is integrated with an AMS VT sensor, under 12nm techonology

- 2nd version:

The lastest version of our sensor is improved in control logic, timing and IO utilization. It is implemented in 65nm technology.

# Prerequisites

These circuits were designed using CadenceÂ® VirtuosoÂ®, Synopsys® Design Compiler®, Cadence® Innovus® and Mentor® Modelsim®. You must also separately obtain the TSMC 65/55nm GP PDK, Global Foundries 12/14nm PDK, ARM 12/14nm standard cell library, and ARM 65/55nm GP-based standard cell library, through MOSIS or a commercial license.

# Setup

Open terminal, change direction to your target folder and type the following code:

```
git clone https://github.com/scale-lab/PVTsensors
```

Detailed instruction will be included in each folder
